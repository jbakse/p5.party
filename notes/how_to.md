# How to use a feature branch

Create Feature Branch

```bash
git branch feature-branch # create a new feature branch
git checkout feature-branch # switch to the feature branch
... commit changes ...
```

Merge with squash

```bash
git rebase master # rebase your changes on top of master
git checkout master # switch back to master


git merge --squash feature-branch # merge your changes into master via a squash
commit ALL the changes as one commit.

# git won't know your branch has been merged, so...
git branch -d feature-branch
# ...will warn you and tell you you need to ...
git branch -D feature-branch
# and remove from origin (e.g. github)
git push origin :feature-branch
```

Merge without squash

```bash
git rebase master
git checkout master
git merge feature-branch
git branch --merged # show the branches that you've merged
git branch -d feature-branch
git push origin :feature-branch
```

# How to update dependencies

```bash
# check to see whats out of date
npm outdated

# update all the things (just minor and patch versions)
npm update

# update a specific package to latest major version
npm install xxx@latest

```

# How to update your local fork with upstream changes

You have forked p5.party and cloned it to your own machine.

You made a change (a bug fix or new feature).

You want to update your fork (both the local clone and on github) with the latest changes from the main p5.party repo.

[Github Docs — Collaborating with Pull Requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests)
[Github Docs — Syncing a Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/syncing-a-fork)

To prepare, if you haven't added the upstream branch:

```
 git remote add upstream https://github.com/jbakse/p5.party.git
```

Make sure you are on the local master branch.

```
git checkout main
```

Fetch the commits from your "upstream" remote that points to p5.party

```
git fetch upstream
```

Merge them in

```
git merge upstream/master
```
